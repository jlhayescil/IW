Set IW.Console as the StartUp project and run.
Files Job1.json, Job2.json, and Job3.json need to be copied to the bin\Debug folder.

Lines 16-28 will print to the console the output based on reading json from the files.
Line 30 calls method GetJobs() which was the original approach reading the information as lists of PrintItems.
GetItems may be commented out to only read the data from files.

Project CalculateCharges contains a factory to calculate the charges.

IW.Test has a few tests to verify the margins being calculated.
